# HackerRank-ArticlesList-REACTChallenge

This is the tried out feature which was part of Hacker Rank React Challenges. It is a cool feature, try it out (if interested).

1) A page where, if an author is entered and fetch button is clicked, the first 3 articles of the author (where title is not empty) needs to be fetched and shown in li tag.

2) List the articles and have two buttons to sort by ascending and descending values for Created-At date.
